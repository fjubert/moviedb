## Overview

<p>This app shows information about the latest and most popular movies and actors, by receiving data from <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3">The Movie DB API</a>.</p>

<p>This app was build using Wordpres with <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock boilerpalte</a> and using <a href="https://understrap.com/">Understrap</a> as a starter theme.

<p>To collect the data from The Movie DB API I created a plugin named The Movie DB Scrapper, located in this repository.
